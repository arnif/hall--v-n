# hall--v-n

A halloween project that integrates against Sonos speakers and a motion sensor connected to Raspberry Pi to spook your neighbourhood kids.

To update the sound json file run:

```bash
node soundScraper.js
```

That should update the `soundFiles.json`. If there are any sounds you don't want to include just remove them from `soundFiles.json` file.
